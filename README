DEVELOPER README
****************

DHIS Mobile is a free and open-source software for low-end Java phones.
It is an extensible application that communicates with the popular HMIS
application called DHIS2. It is a JavaME application that downloads forms
from DHIS2 or Community DHIS into the mobile phone and displays 
datasets or program stages on which a health worker can enter data and 
sends to the online server.

DHIS Mobile Developers are spread across the world and are located around 
the world. The project is maintained at: https://launchpad.net/dhis-mobile

Here is some introductory info to get you started:

Initial reading
===============

The source-code is stored in the launchpad Bazaar repository and bugs/features
are tracked at the launchpad project site. The primary discussion around the
project happens at the developers mailing lists and joining the project at
launchpad is the best way to get started.

A related research project which is associated with the application and its
design, development, implementation and evaluation is through the MobiHealth
project at the University of Oslo: http://www.hisp.uio.no/projects/mobihealth/

Building from source-code
=========================

Developers should start by downloading the source-code using the Bazaar distributed
version control system <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>. After installing bazaar,
the source code can be downloaded anonymously using command $> bzr branch lp:dhis-mobile

Extract the project-files.zip into the same folder. These are required files for opening
the project through Eclipse and allow easy importing the project to Eclipse workspace 

The mobile application is developed using the MTJ Eclipse plugin. Thus, Eclipse needs to
be downloaded and installed. After installing eclipse, MTJ needs to be installed using
instructions located here: http://live.eclipse.org/node/614

You would also like to install different JavaME emulators (e.g. WTK 2.5.2) to be able to
emulate and view the application instead of having to copy the application to a mobile 
phone.

After installing the MTJ plugin, start/restart Eclipse and in the menu File->Import, 
General -> Existing projects into workspace, then Next and Browse to the DHISMobile folder
in the downloaded source.
